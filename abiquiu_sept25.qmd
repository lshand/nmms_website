**Parking:** If you are camping, you can park at the campsite. If you plan to just come up for the morning swim on Sunday, you may be able to park at the camp site but this is TBD. If parking in day use area, you must purchase a day use pass. This can be done at the machine near the boat ramp. The machine at the swim beach is out of order.
